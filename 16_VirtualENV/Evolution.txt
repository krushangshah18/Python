Evolution of Virtual Environments in Python
1️⃣ virtualenv (Initial Solution — external package)
⚙ Before Python 3.3

Python originally did not include any virtual environment tool.
So developers used:

pip install virtualenv
virtualenv myenv

🔹 Why it was needed

To isolate dependencies per project
Avoid conflicts in global site-packages

🔹 Key point: virtualenv was not built into Python, so it required installation.


2️⃣ venv (Built-in virtual environment module)
🐍 Introduced in Python 3.3

Python added venv inside the standard library to replace the external virtualenv.

Create environment:

python3 -m venv myenv

Activate:

source myenv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
myenv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

🔹 Why it replaced virtualenv

No installation needed, built-in
Simpler, cleaner
Recommended by Python core team

🔸 Limitation:

Basic functionality only
Slow package installs
No dependency resolution or lock files


3️⃣ uv (Modern ultra-fast environment & package manager)
⚡ 2024-2025 (Rust-based, very fast)

A new tool by Astral-Sh:

replaces pip, venv, pipx, pip-tools
installs and resolves packages extremely fast

Create environment:
uv venv

Install packages:
uv add requests

Run inside:
uv run main.py
